Thank you for considering a contribution! I welcome PRs from everyone.

## Getting started
### Don't see your issue? Create one.
If you spot a mistake (you probably will since I made this), open an issue using a template. I'll have a nice little chat with you, trying to assist you :D
### Want to fix it yourself? Fork it.
There is a high chance I won't be able to fix your issue, but if you're smart enough, you can fix my mistakes yourself!
 - Fork the repository
 - Add the changes
 - Make a Pull Request
 - done!


Once again, thank you for contributing and may god have mercy on your soul
